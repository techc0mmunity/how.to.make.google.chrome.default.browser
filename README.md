Using the internet is something we often take for granted. We jump on any device, access a browser, and begin searching for answers to everything. The only problem is that there are multiple browsers to choose from. Of course, we don't just browse on one device anymore. One of the most frustrating parts of having multiple browsers is transferring all your bookmarks and favorites. It could be a real pain if your browsers aren't synced across devices.

The Google Chrome browser responds to users’ demands by working on multiple platforms. Google Chrome's simplistic design makes it easy to navigate, while you can easily add extensions, add-ons, and import bookmarks to customize it however you like. The only downside to the Chrome browser is that it’s difficult to have multiple users on one device. Still, it's an easily accessible browser that receives constant updates and is readily available on most devices.

## Why you should use Google Chrome as your default browser

Chrome is fully integrated with the Google ecosystem, allowing users to sync with their email, calendar, drive, and more. You can also cast your browser using Chromecast. The best part is that Chrome allows you to maintain settings across every device. Once you install Chrome, you can create an account with a Gmail address and sync all the data by signing in on the other devices. This means no more trying to remember all your bookmarks as you jump between your phone, work computer, tablet, or laptop.
